    <body>My name is Kline C. Avila, and I was born on July 4, 2001. My parents are Roger W. Avila and Helen C. Avila. I have four siblings, making us a total of five, which consists of three girls and two boys.

	    <p>In my free time, I enjoy simple yet meaningful hobbies. I love watching movies as they allow me to explore different stories and perspectives from around the world. 
        I also enjoy reading books, which help me expand my imagination and knowledge while offering peace and relaxation.
        Aside from my interest in films and literature, I am also a dog and fish lover. I have a Shih Tzu named Mocho, who brings joy and comfort to my everyday life, and a betta fish that adds color and calmness to my home. 
        Taking care of them teaches me patience, love, responsibility, and compassion.</p>

        <p>I was born and raised in Lapu-Lapu City, and after completing my primary education in Bankal, we relocated to Compostela, Cebu, where my father resided before meeting my mother, and there, I pursued my secondary education. 
        Eventually, after finishing my junior high school education, I returned to Lapu-Lapu City to pursue my desired track, 
        which is Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS), as my former school did not offer this strand.</p>

	    <p>Upon graduating, my reality did not unfold as I had envisioned. During the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
        I found myself in the middle of an online college admission interview when my connection dropped, resulting in the interview being interrupted due to the poor signal in my area.
        I was given another opportunity to resume the interview, but unfortunately, it still did not succeed.</p>

	    <p>And then I made a significant decision to leave school and pursue employment. After spending four years in the workforce, I came to a realization that time moves quickly, and I am not getting any younger. 
        Those years of working gave me valuable experiences, lessons, friendship, met the person who loved me for who I am, and a deeper understanding of responsibility and perseverance. 
        However, I also felt that something was missing — my dream of completing my studies and building a better future for myself.</p>
        
        <p>With that realization, I made one of the most important decisions in my life: to stop working and continue pursuing my education. 
        It wasn’t an easy choice, but I knew that investing in knowledge is something that will last a lifetime. I want to improve myself, not just for my own success but also to make a meaningful contribution to others in the future.
        Returning to school is both a challenge and a new beginning for me. It’s a step toward personal growth, a reminder that it’s never too late to chase your dreams, and that learning has no age limit.</p>
